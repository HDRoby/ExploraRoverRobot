# Explora
6 wheels drive, all terrain, autonomous robot designed as a platform to experiment with self driving vehicle.

Explora Robot is based on a well known commercial chassis widely available for hobbists 
[Dagu Thumper 6WD](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11056).

Aim of this project is to design and build a robotic platform that in the initial implementation will provide a set of interfaces, either software and hardware, that allow to build new layers with extended functionalities. Basic initial capabilities will include:

- indoor and outdoor navigation
- remote control and monitoring via wifi, BT and 2.4GHz RF radio 
- obstacle avoidance
- simultaneus location and mapping (SLAM)
- GPS viewpoints and landmark navigation through video processing
- terrain negotiation via IMU
